# Data Science

This repository contains projects pertaining to data science. These projects demonstrate my skill to scrape large amounts of data and parse it accordingly. There are two projects which I believe highlight my skills the most.

These are the Baltimore Crime Map and League of Legends Matchups. Both of the projects are in the form of a jupyter/python notebook but I have converted them to html format for ease of viewing. The notebooks contains code snippets, developer notes, and code output.

For ease of access, I have utilized github's html preview and appended my files so you can visit them directly.

#### Please note, I utilized a tool ,nbconvert, which converts .ipynb (python notebook) files to .html.

## Project Summary

These projects go through the stages of the data science pipeline:

### Scraping Data  
Retrieveing data from either an online database or some other source, XML file, JSON, etc

### Parsing / Cleaning  
After the data has been loaded into a program, this section takes only the valuable portions and manipulates it into a usable
format, separating tables, moving entries into an array etc.
 
### Analysis  
Performing calculations or other forms of analysis in order to draw a conclusion about the data

### Visualization
Use some sort of data visualizer in order to graph the data in order to make it more readable
