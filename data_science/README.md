# Data Science

This repository contains projects pertaining to data science. These projects demonstrate my skill to scrape large amounts of
data and parse it accordingly. There are two projects which I believe highlight my skills the most.

These are the Baltimore Crime Map and League of Legends Matchups. Both of the projects are in the form of a jupyter/python
notebook but I have converted them to html format for ease of viewing.

For ease of access, I have utilized github's html preview and appended my files so you can visit them directly.
