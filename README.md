# Demos

Hi, this is my personal repository containing projects that I believe highlight my best skills and programmming practices.
This will serve as a table of contents of sorts and will give a brief over view over some of the projects that I have listed
on this github.

My projects will be separated by category. Under each section, it will contain a general overview of each project, such as 
its intended goal/purpose and some other specifics as well, programming language, and other skills.

### Data Science 
The Data science repository will contain 2 (two) projects, Baltimore Crime Map, and League of Legends Matchups. These projects
were written in python and they utilize the numpy and pandas libraries from python. These projects are intended to demonstrate
my skills in data processing and analysis. The two projects are originally compiled in a jupyter/python notebook but I have reformated
them into an html file for ease of access and viewability.

### Computer and Network security
This repository contains the Gradebook program. This project is a command line program written in C. The Gradebook project is 
a basic program that simulates a program used by teacher/professors. It is a fully built shell type program which executes
in a loop and takes input from the user through the console/command line. It is capable of receiving and storing data (classes, students, grades, etc.) from the user and accessing it at a later time, it uses File I/O as its main storage. Functions will be continously read
and executed until the process is forced close/halted, or if the user exits the program themselves. 

### Computer Vision
This repository contains a Panorama Stitching program. This program was written using MATLAB The program takes in several images and attempts to stitch them together so that
they are all viewable from one frame. It does so by comparing the corners in each picture to determine an estimated offset from 
one picture to another. Once it has compared anough corners, a mapping is created for the entire photo. Each pixel is passed 
through the mapping. The end result is a composited image which contains both of the preceeding images layered ontop of one another.
