# Demos

Hi, this is my personal repository containing projects that I believe highlight my best skills and programmming practices.
This will serve as a table of contents of sorts and will give a brief over view over some of the projects that I have listed
on this github.

My projects will be separated by category. Under each section, it will contain a general overview of each project, such as 
its intended goal/purpose and some other specifics as well, programming language, and other skills.

### Data Science 
The Data science repository will contain 2 (two) projects, Baltimore Crime Map, and League of Legends Matchups. These projects
were written in python and they utilize the numpy and pandas libraries from python. These projects are intended to demonstrate
my skills in data processing and analysis. The two projects are originally compiled in a jupyter/python notebook but I have reformated
them into an html file for ease of access and viewability.

### Computer and Network security
This repository contains the Gradebook program. This project is a command line program written in C. The Gradebook project is 
a basic program that simulates a program used by teacher/professors. As such, it is a fully built shell type program which executes
in a loop and takes input from the user through the console/command line. Functions will be continously read and executed until
the process is forced close/halted, or if the user exits the program themselves.
